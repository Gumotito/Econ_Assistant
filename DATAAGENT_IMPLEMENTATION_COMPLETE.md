## 🏗️ Architecture

### Trust Score System

```
HIGH VALUE (1.0):
  - statistica.md
  - data.worldbank.org
  - imf.org
  - comtrade.un.org
  - bnm.md (National Bank of Moldova)

MEDIUM VALUE (0.8-0.85):
  - tradingeconomics.com (0.8)
  - ceicdata.com (0.8)
  - europa.eu/eurostat (0.85)
  - oecd.org (0.85)

USER PROVIDED (0.7):
  - Uploaded CSV/Excel files

WEB SEARCH (0.6):
  - General DuckDuckGo results
```

### DataAgent Class

```python
class DataAgent:
    def upload_dataset(file_path, name, description, trust_score)
        # Loads CSV/Excel with pandas
        # Validates columns and rows
        # Indexes to ChromaDB with metadata
        # Returns success message
    
    def list_datasets()
        # Queries ChromaDB for dataset metadata
        # Returns list with name, description, trust_score, doc count
    
    def delete_dataset(dataset_name)
        # Placeholder - requires ChromaDB bulk delete
    
    def verify_data_point(claim, current_value, web_results)
        # Cross-checks against official sources
        # Calculates confidence score
        # Returns verification result
    
    def get_trust_score(source_name)
        # Looks up source in TRUSTED_SOURCES
        # Returns 0-1 score (default 0.7 for user data)
```

### New Tools for LLM

1. **search_official_sources**
   - Description: "Search ONLY official high-trust sources: statistica.md, World Bank, IMF, UN Comtrade, National Bank of Moldova"
   - Parameters: `query` (string)
   - Returns: Search results with trust_score=1.0

2. **verify_with_sources**
   - Description: "Cross-check a data claim against official sources to verify accuracy"
   - Parameters: `claim` (string), `current_value` (optional string)
   - Returns: Verification result with confidence score

3. **list_datasets**
   - Description: "List all available datasets with descriptions"
   - Parameters: None
   - Returns: Formatted list of datasets

4. **get_source_trust_score**
   - Description: "Get trust/reliability score (0-1) for a data source"
   - Parameters: `source_name` (string)
   - Returns: Trust score with explanation

### Weighted Search Algorithm

```python
# 1. Fetch 3x results (to allow for filtering)
fetch_count = n_results * 3

# 2. Filter by min_trust threshold
if trust_score >= min_trust:
    # Include in results

# 3. Weight distance by trust score
weighted_dist = distance / (trust_score + 0.1)

# 4. Sort by weighted distance, take top n_results
```

**Result:** High-trust sources rank higher even with slightly lower semantic similarity.

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### 1. Upload Dataset via UI

```html
<!-- User action -->
1. Click "Choose File" → Select Moldova_GDP_2023.csv
2. Enter name: "Moldova GDP Historical"
3. Enter description: "GDP data from National Statistics"
4. Select trust: "Medium Trust (0.7)"
5. Click "Upload Dataset"

<!-- Result -->
✓ Success: Indexed 50 rows from Moldova GDP Historical
```

### 2. Search Official Sources

```python
# LLM tool call
{
  "tool": "search_official_sources",
  "arguments": {"query": "Moldova GDP 2023"}
}

# Result
"Found 3 results from official sources:
1. [World Bank] Moldova GDP: $15.5B (2023)
2. [statistica.md] PIB Moldova: 15.5 miliarde USD
3. [IMF] Republic of Moldova - Economic Indicators"
```

### 3. Verify Data

```python
# LLM tool call
{
  "tool": "verify_with_sources",
  "arguments": {
    "claim": "Moldova GDP in 2023 was $15.5 billion"
  }
}

# Result
"✓ VERIFIED with HIGH confidence (95%)
- World Bank confirms: $15.5B
- National Statistics confirms: 15.5 miliarde USD
- IMF data matches
Recommendation: Data is highly reliable."
```

### 4. Query with Trust Filtering

```python
# Backend search call
results = db_service.search(
    query="Moldova trade statistics",
    n_results=5,
    min_trust=0.8  # Only official/high-value sources
)

# Returns only results from:
# - statistica.md (1.0)
# - World Bank (1.0)
# - tradingeconomics.com (0.8)
# Filters out general web (0.6) and some user data (0.7)
```

## 📋 Technical Debt & Improvements

### Known Limitations

1. **Delete Dataset** - Placeholder only, needs ChromaDB bulk delete implementation
2. **Update Trust Score** - Works but doesn't update existing documents (needs bulk update)
3. **File Size Limits** - No current limit on upload size (add validation)
4. **Format Support** - Only CSV/Excel (could add JSON, Parquet)

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Caching** - Cache dataset metadata separately from ChromaDB
2. **Validation** - More robust CSV validation (encoding, delimiters)
3. **Progress** - Upload progress bar for large files
4. **Preview** - Show dataset preview before full upload
5. **Async** - Background processing for large dataset uploads

### Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation** - Guardrails already validate uploads
2. **File Scanning** - Consider adding virus scanning for production
3. **Rate Limiting** - Already implemented (50 req/60s)
4. **Storage Limits** - Add per-user storage quotas for B2B
